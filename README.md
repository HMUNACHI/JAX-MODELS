Welcome to the Jax-Models repository! This repository is a curated collection of deep learning concepts, models, algorithms, and more, all implemented from scratch using JAX, a powerful numerical computing library. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence. The codes are designed for easy copy and paste, and we try to be as detailed as possible in the documentation. Each implementation will be roll out once all tests are passed, watch and star to keep up!

## Contents

The repository covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Deep Learning Concepts**: Explore various attention mechanisms (Multi-Head, Multi-Query, Relative, Gated, Hierarchical, Local, Rotary etc.), positional encoding variants (Sinusoidal, Learned, Rotary, etc.), and other foundational concepts.

- **Model Implementations**: Discover implementations of state-of-the-art models such as T5, LaMDA, FLAN, GPT, InstructGPT, Llama, SeamlesM4T, Clip, Starcoder, CodeLlama, MLP-Mixers, Whisper, ViT, Swin and more. Each model is accompanied by detailed documentation for ease of understanding.

- **Distributed Trainers**: Learn about different distributed training techniques for tasks like CausalLM, Seq2Seq, Contrastive, Reinforcement, Adversarial, Diffusion, and more.

- **Advanced Algorithms**: Dive into the implementation details of algorithms like Gaussian processes, Mixture of Experts (MoE), Principal Component Analysis, Gaussian Mixture models (GMM), KMeans decoding strategies, knowledge graphs, vocabulary tries, Jaccard, Hamming, Entropy &  evaluation algorithms and more.

- **Mathematical Foundations**: Explore mathematical concepts crucial to deep learning, including Newton Methods, Secant, Taylor Series, Eigen Decomposition, SVD, Probability Calculators & Distributions, Bayesian methods, Monte Carlo simulations, Numerical Integrals & Derivatives Calculators, and other fundamental principles.

- **Data Classes**: We include managed memory-efficient Data classes for Seq2Seq, CausalLM, Classification, Unsupervised etc.Simply instantiate the class with you directory/bucket with list of ".txt" files and it will complete the process from corpus creation, BPE-based tokenizer, splitting etc. The object would finally have train_loader, val_loader and tokenizer attributes.
